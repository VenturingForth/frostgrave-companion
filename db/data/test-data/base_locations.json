However, this extra soldier cannot be used in a game and must remain in the base. Even with an inn, a wizard is still limited to eight soldiers in a game, with a maximum of four specialists. The wizard may change which soldier is left in the inn each game, which is useful if a soldier must miss a game due to injury.",
